To enable them do:

- add this at the end of the zsh config file (~/.zshrc)

# Load custom functions
fpath+=/home/plambri/scripts/zsh_functions
autoload parse_nfs_errors

- The "autoload" has to be repeated for each file (so each function, one file one function) in the path
- Save and reload zsh:

$ exec zsh
